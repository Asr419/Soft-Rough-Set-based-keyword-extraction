# Soft-Rough-Set-based-keyword-extraction
SRS based keyword extraction
The present work proposes an application of Soft Rough Set and its span for unsupervised keyword extraction. Soft Rough Sets are being applied in various domains, though none of its applications are in the area of keyword extraction. On the other hand, the concept of Rough Set based span has been developed for improved efficiency in the domain of extractive text summarization. In this work we amalgamate these two techniques to provide an effective solution for keyword extraction from texts. The universe for Soft Rough Set is taken as a collection of words from the input texts. Soft Rough Set based span provides an ideal platform for identifying the set of keywords from the input text which cannot always be defined clearly and unambiguously. The proposed technique uses greedy algorithm for computing spanning sets. The experimental results suggest that extraction of keywords using the proposed scheme gives consistent results across different domains. The proposed algorithm has ben found to be more efficient in comparison with several existing unsupervised techniques.
